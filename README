Antminer L3+ Voltage Control tool

cryptodad (C) 2018

v1.0	- Initial release
v1.1	- altered auto-tune options. Now can tune with a start and end frequency
v1.2	- monitor ASIC chip temperature whilst auto-tuning
v1.3 	- added -e option, enhanced -r option output
		- hopefully resolved the "Wrong PIC version" message
v1.4	- added fan mode and speed % + some code tidying
v1.5	- added estimated power to  -r option
v1.6	- fixed ioctl error
v1.7	- tidying up output text
v1.8	- added hashrate to monitor output


This tool was written after having used the Blissz firmware. It is very good, but I do not like the constant paying for 
something. If I like it, I pay once!
I later found a free tool that set voltages, but it expected the user to input hexadecimal values, which isn't exactly 
user friendly. I attempted contact with the author, but never received a reply.

So, the birth of 'at' (auto tune).

AutoTune (at) is a Linux command line tool. It needs to be installed on the L3+ Antminer in the /config directory.

Installation
	I am only supplying instructions for Windows 10 as I have never used Apple equipment. 
	The following instructions are not for a novice.

	copy two files 'at' and 'at.conf' to your Antminer L3+
		open a cmd window
			scp at* root@<antminer ip address>:/config
		you will be prompted for your Antminer root password - the default is root unless you have changed it

	execute the tool
		in the same cmd window
			ssh root@<antminer ip address>
		you will be prompted for your Antminer root password
			cd /config
		do the following once - need to make it executable
			chmod +x ./at
		now run the following command
			./at -r 
		A list of the current hash-board voltages will be displayed
		
Options
	-a <time 1 to 10> {<start frequency> <end frequency>} auto-tune all hash boards for the current frequency
	   or auto-tune from the start frequency through to end frequency if arguments supplied
	-b restart miner
	-c <speed percentage 50 to 99> set fan speed - will restart the miner
	-h display help
	-f <frequency 375 to 500> set frequency for all hash boards
	-m <target temperature 45 to 70 C> monitor chip temperatures and reduce frequency to keep below set 
	   temperature
	-r read hash board voltages, temperatures, power and fan speed / mode 
	-v <hash board 1-4> <voltage 9.0 to 11.0> set hash board voltage
	-s shutdown Antminer - stops the mining process and temporarily halts the OS, allowing a safe power-off

Example
	./at -f 400
		sets all hash boards to 400MHz and restarts miner
	./at -a 1
		starts auto-tune for the current frequency with a 1 minute test per voltage increment.
		
	Auto-tune initially sets each hash board voltage to 9.0v
	The miner will mine for the chosen time (in this example, it's 1 minute)
	The voltage will be increased by 0.1v until no more than 1 HW error per minute is seen.
	In theory, we can increase the voltage to 11.0v, but I have not tried beyond 10.5v. At completion, the voltages 
	are recorded in at.conf.
	
Since v1.1, auto-tune can now tune between a start frequency and end frequency. This is the preferred way of
using the feature.

Example
	./at -a 5 400 500
		auto-tune starting at 400MHz with 5 minutes of mining per voltage increment. Auto-tune will stop after 500MHz
		tuning has completed
	
	WARNING:
	when auto-tuning, you MUST monitor your ASIC chip temperatures. Personally, I do not like going over 70C. 
	
	NOTE:
	longer tuning times are preferred (greater than 5 minutes), as after every successful tune, the Antminer is
	restarted, which allows cooling off. From tests, it takes around 5 minutes to stabalise again.

If you intend to use the -m option (temperature monitor), then it is suggested you run -a (auto tune) on all 
frequencies you intend to operate over. If -m were to reduce the frequency to a non-tuned frequency then it is likely 
the temperature would increase as it would default to 10.0v per hash-board, which would increase the temperatures, 
thus resulting in further frequency drops.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
	
NOTES:
The Bitmain specification for the L3+ states input voltages of up to 13v are allowed. They also state that higher 
efficiencies come with higher voltages.
Computer power supplies, used to provide power to the Antminer, are rated at 12v. However, they are never accurate. 
When measured, you will likely see anything from 11v to 13v, hence Bitmain's statement on input voltage range as the 
L3+ does not have any voltage regulation.
This tool tunes the voltage by altering values to the PIC controller. My scale of 9.0v to 11.0v is for reference only,
as the voltages are not actually tuned to these values - again, that's because there is no voltage regulation. 
Everything is referenced to the DC input voltage.

Since v1.5, estimated power is displayed in the output of -r. These values are an attempt to show the power usage of
each hashboard on the Antminer side. You must then convert the values to match your power supplies efficiency rating.
For example, if -r reports total power of 800w, and your power supply has an efficiency rating of 93%, then the 
"at wall" estimated power will be 800 * 1.07 = 856w.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

TROUBLE SHOOTING:
	Wrong PIC Version:
	If seen at first use then the software will not run on your Antminer.
	If seen during a tuning session, then it is likely caused by contention with Bitmain's drivers. In which case
	the only way to clear, is an Antminer power-cycle.
	
	Ioctl error:
	If seen during a tuning session, then it is likely caused by contention with Bitmain's drivers. In which case
	the only way to clear, is an Antminer power-cycle.
